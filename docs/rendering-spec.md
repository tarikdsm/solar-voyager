# Rendering Specification — Solar Voyager

## 1. Camera-relative rendering (floating origin)

- Physics is float64 heliocentric km; the GPU is float32. The bridge lives in **exactly one place**: `render/spaceScene.ts`.
- Every frame, for each visual: `scenePos = toFloat32(bodyPos_f64 − cameraPos_f64)`. The three.js camera sits at the scene origin `(0,0,0)` permanently.
- **1 scene unit = 1 km.** Near objects get sub-millimeter-true positions; distant objects' float32 error is sub-pixel by construction.
- Never store or accumulate positions in float32 — recompute from float64 each frame.

## 2. Depth (ADR-008)

Prefer **`reversedDepthBuffer: true`** when `EXT_clip_control` is available — faster (keeps early-Z) and more precise; fall back to `logarithmicDepthBuffer: true`. Near plane 0.001 (1 m), far 1e10 km (beyond Eris). No manual depth partitioning. Both paths CI-tested for z-artifacts (Earth from 200 km and from 1 AU). Context creation policy (high-performance, software-rasterizer detection): `docs/performance-spec.md` §2.

## 3. Visual ladder — 3 tiers per body (by projected angular size)

| Tier | Condition | Representation |
|---|---|---|
| 1 — Point | < ~1.5 px | Additive point sprite; size/brightness from apparent magnitude computed from real radius, distance, geometric albedo, phase angle. Planets look like wandering stars from afar — correct at real scale. |
| 2 — Sphere | 1.5 px – ~200 px | Icosphere L2 with a dedicated KTX2 albedo (2k planets; 1k moons, dwarfs and small bodies); no normal map. |
| 3 — Full model | > ~200 px | Blender-authored glTF (Draco): normal maps, Saturn/Uranus rings as textured annuli (double-sided, alpha), comet coma+tail as camera-facing sprites scaled by heliocentric distance near perihelion. |

- Only the sphere-tier resources for Sun/Earth/Moon load at startup. Other tier-2 albedos load on approach; every tier-3 glTF and hero texture is lazy, including Sun/Earth/Moon (ADR-023).
- Hysteresis on tier switches (±20%) to avoid popping.
- **Fidelity rule — no artistic scaling, ever:** a body's rendered angular size always equals its true angular size from the camera position (real radii, real distances). The view out the window is exactly what a real ship at that state vector would see. The tier ladder changes *representation*, never *apparent size or brightness class*.

Projected diameter is `2 asin(min(1, radiusKm / distanceKm)) × viewportHeightPx / verticalFovRad`.
The nominal 1.5/200 px boundaries use twenty-percent hysteresis: point→sphere
at 1.8 px and sphere→point below 1.2 px; sphere→model at 240 px and
model→sphere below 160 px.

Reflected-body brightness relative to the Sun at the observer is
`p × Φ(α) × radiusKm² × observerSunKm² / (bodySunKm² × observerBodyKm²)`,
where `p` is geometric albedo and the Lambert phase function is
`Φ(α) = (sin α + (π - α) cos α) / π`. Solar apparent magnitude is -26.74 at
1 AU and follows inverse-square distance. Singular centre/surface observations
are clamped to finite physical fallback distances so tier attributes never
receive NaN or infinity.

## 4. Lighting & post

- **One directional light**, positioned in the focus-to-Sun direction and aimed
  at the origin so the rays travel Sun-to-focus. For focus distance `dKm`, its
  intensity is `π × (AU_KM / max(dKm, solarRadiusKm))²`; therefore a normal-facing
  Lambertian surface reproduces its base colour at 1 AU and the Sun-focused
  case remains finite at the photosphere.
- The one HDR chain is `RenderPass → UnrealBloomPass → OutputPass` over
  half-float composer buffers. The renderer uses **ACES filmic tone mapping**
  at exposure 1.0; `OutputPass` performs tone mapping and output conversion
  once, at the end. Bloom uses threshold 1.0, strength 0.15, radius 0.35, and
  the official half-resolution bright target.
- Sun rendered **procedurally** (ADR-010, task T0084): animated convective granulation, limb darkening, prominence arcs + billboard glare — the static emissive texture is only a fallback. Gas giants animate their real base maps with procedural band flow (T0085). Policy for all procedural shading (tiers, bake-at-load rule, governor octave rung): ADR-010.
- Until T0084, the fallback Sun material has minimum emissive intensity 4 and
  one additive, depth-tested 64×64 radial glare sprite spans four solar
  diameters. Its alpha reaches zero at every edge, preventing square artifacts.
- Night sides are genuinely dark; the global ambient floor is exactly 0.02 for
  playability. Earth keeps its authored night-light emissive map with minimum
  intensity 32 at the fixed exposure so localized city lights remain visible.
- Earth atmosphere: simple rim/fresnel shader in v1 (full scattering is a future task).

## 5. Starfield

- Yale Bright Star Catalog (9,096 coordinate-bearing entries, public domain) baked by `tools/bake_stars.py` into `data/stars.bin`. The 254,688-byte payload is a raw little-endian stream of seven Float32 values per star: `(dirX, dirY, dirZ, visualMagnitude, red, green, blue)`, stride 28 bytes. Directions are unit vectors in the ecliptic J2000 frame; RGB is a bounded display mapping of B−V, with neutral white for missing color indices.
- Rendered as one `THREE.Points` on a 1e9 km sphere centered on the camera (moves with it). The static object is never registered as a physical position binding and has no per-frame update or allocation. Correct at every warp translation and zoom; no skybox textures.
- For visual magnitude `m`, setup computes `F = 10^(-0.4m)`, `sizeCssPx = clamp(1, 4, 1 + 1.5 F^0.25)`, and `opacity = clamp(0, 1, 10^(-0.4(m - 1)))`. Point size is multiplied by renderer pixel ratio; unresolved points retain a one-fragment footprint and resolved points use a soft circular profile. Catalog B−V RGB passes through unchanged.
- Star vertices are forced to the selected depth strategy's far plane (`z=w` for normal/logarithmic, `z=0` for reversed depth). The additive material uses a less-or-equal logical depth test against the cleared far plane but never writes depth, so every opaque near-field body occludes stars regardless of its camera-relative distance while the starfield cannot occlude later transparent effects.

## 6. Launch scene (2D) — DEFERRED (optional post-v1 expansion, see roadmap)

Same renderer, orthographic camera, side view: rocket sprite/low-poly model, Earth limb, atmosphere gradient by altitude, exhaust plume scaling with throttle and ambient pressure. Parallax cloud/ground layers near the pad (Alcântara coastline silhouette).

## 7. Trajectory & map rendering

- Predicted path: polyline from the worker (≤2000 pts), rendered camera-relative as `Line2` (fat lines), color-coded by dominant body; event markers (SOI, closest approach, impact) as billboarded icons.
- Osculating conic: analytic ellipse (64–256 segments) around the dominant body, updated every frame — instant feedback while the worker refines.
- System map: separate three.js scene, top-down-capable free orbit camera, bodies as scaled icons + orbit lines, same snapshot data.

## 8. Performance & asset budgets (CI-gated)

| Budget | Limit |
|---|---|
| Repo total | < 300 MB |
| `public/assets/` | < 150 MB |
| Initial critical path (code + Sun/Earth/Moon + stars) | < 8 MB |
| Frame budget (mid-range laptop, 1080p) | 16.6 ms; render ≤ 10 ms — full budget table and 60 fps contract: `performance-spec.md` §1 |
| Draw calls / triangles (typical view) | ≤ 150 / ≤ 500k |
| Tier-3 model | ≤ 50k tris planets, ≤ 5k asteroids |

- All textures KTX2 (ETC1S for albedo, UASTC for normal maps); all meshes Draco.
- `npm run check:budgets` fails CI when exceeded.

## 9. HUD state-vector widget (bottom-right)

A miniature 3D axis triad in its own small viewport (same WebGL renderer, scissor test), rendering the CM-relative vectors from the snapshot (physics-spec §6): velocity, proper acceleration, linear momentum p = γmv, angular momentum L. Design goals: *elegant* — thin anti-aliased lines, soft glow tips, subtle grid disc for the ecliptic plane, magnitude labels with SI-prefix formatting, logarithmic vector-length scaling (linear would be useless across 30 km/s → 0.99c). Orientation follows the main camera by default; pinnable to fixed ecliptic axes. Adjacent energy panel (DOM, Preact) shows Wh/W figures. Budget: the widget viewport must cost < 1 ms/frame.

## 10. Relativistic visual effects (quality-gated, ship near c)

When γ is significant (threshold ~1.05), a full-screen shader pass applies, in order of gameplay value: (1) **relativistic aberration** — star/body directions transformed by the velocity boost, the sky compresses toward the direction of travel; (2) **Doppler shift** — starfield B-V colors shifted blue ahead / red behind; (3) **headlight beaming** — intensity boost ahead. Applied to the starfield and point-sprite tiers (correct transformation of directions), approximated for near-field geometry. OFF at low quality; the effect must interpolate smoothly as γ→1 (no popping when crossing the threshold). This is v1-optional polish (M6 task) — the sim is relativistic regardless.

## 11. Close-range surface fidelity (real-scale bodies)

Real scale means a 4k equirectangular map on Earth is ~10 km/pixel — sharp from afar, mush from low orbit. Fidelity near a body comes from **layers**, not from impossibly large textures:

1. **Hero texture tier:** 8k albedo for Earth/Mars/Moon (4k others), 4k macro normal maps — the base layer (MODELING-GUIDE §5).
2. **Tiling detail maps (the workhorse):** seamless 1k detail normal + albedo-variation pairs per surface class (rock, ice, regolith, gas banding), blended in by the surface shader starting at ~5 body-radii and fully in by ~1.2 radii, keyed by a per-body detail scale. Two octaves (macro tile + micro tile at ~8× frequency) kill visible repetition. Fades with distance so the far view is untouched.
3. **Procedural shader noise:** low-cost fbm modulating roughness/normal at the closest range, seeded per body — breaks up the last visible texel edges.
4. **Mipmap discipline:** KTX2 full mip chains, anisotropy 4; never sample beyond native resolution (the detail layers take over instead).
5. **Atmosphere & clouds:** Earth cloud layer as a slightly larger shell (independent rotation), rim/fresnel atmosphere shader — both mask the surface transition zone naturally.
6. **Geometry:** tier-3 meshes (≤50k tris) are enough for orbital-only v1 (no terrain landing); silhouette smoothness is guaranteed by the quad-sphere subdivision, not displacement. If landing arrives post-v1, a CDLOD/quadtree patch system becomes its own ADR.

Ring systems (Saturn, Uranus, Jupiter, Neptune): annulus at true radial ratios, 2048×64 radial strip where alpha = optical depth; shader adds planet shadow across the ring, ring shadow on the planet, and backlit transmission (unlit side glows faintly when the Sun is behind) — the three cues that read as "real rings".

## 12. Quality settings — adaptive governor (ADR-008)

Quality is owned at runtime by the **adaptive quality governor** (`performance-spec.md` §3): a measured control loop (p75 frame time, hysteresis) walking an ordered knob ladder (render scale → bloom → AA → star cap → texture cap → tier thresholds) to hold the 60 fps floor. The settings menu exposes a tier lock (manual override always wins) and shows the governor's current tier. Initial tier auto-detected from `devicePixelRatio` + a loading-screen timing probe.
